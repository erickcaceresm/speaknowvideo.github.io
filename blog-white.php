      <p class="color-white">Do you know what White Label is, one of the most used expressions in the business
        world?</p>
      <p class="color-white">If you don't know it, we explain it to you now! White Label refers to the possibility
        of offering additional technologies and resources to your customers, outsourcing a structure of products,
        services, or models previously made.</p>
      <p class="color-white">Many companies have used this possibility to create new solutions, increase customer
        LTV, offer to upsell, and generate value for the customer.</p>
      <p class="color-white">Do you want to better understand the White Label practice and know if it is a good idea
        for your company? Check out the full article!</p>

        <h3 class="article-subtitle">The origin of the term white label</h3>
        <p class="color-white">Although the term white label is today closely linked to technology, it was first
          used in connection with music.</p>
        <p class="color-white">Some time ago, to get songs released, record companies used to send CDs to renowned
          DJs, allowing them to mix the artists' songs as they pleased. Thus, the term white label was born.</p>
        <p class="color-white">This history is closely related to white label in the business world since it
          consists of allowing a product or service developed by a company to be resold by other companies or
          individuals without having to show copyright.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="article-subtitle">White label in the business world</h3>
        <p class="color-white">From music to the business world, White Label consists of outsourcing the
          development of products and services. In this way, a mold is created that can be customized and
          redistributed. In other words, a product, service, or technology is developed by a given company but is
          resold under the brand of an ally.</p>
        <p class="color-white">Thus, the company that originated the solution transfers the white label so that
          the discloser, or reseller, of the services, can add its brand. </p>
        <p class="color-white">Let's take a practical example, imagine an interpreting platform that offers its
          users all the necessary resources for them to offer interpreting services for their clients.</p>
        <p class="color-white">The creator offers a White Label service, which will be perceived by the end
          customer as a site belonging to your interpreting agency and not as an outsourced one. Think also of the
          banking platform that allows users to develop applications, with the company's logo, to manage financial
          services.</p>
        <p class="color-white">This is another White Label solution, in which the "end" company does not have to
          bear the costs of production or creation of the solution and does not move away from its core business. In
          short, we can understand White Label as a "rental service". With it, the product can be adapted to the
          needs and image of the reseller company. </p>
        <p class="color-white">Therefore, the supplier's name and brand are invisible to users and only the
          reseller's brand is visible. On the other hand, there are no rights to the license of the product or
          service.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="article-subtitle">White label vs. Franchise model: what is the difference?</h3>
        <p class="color-white">It is common to confuse the white label model with the franchise model since the
          concept of both is similar. In the end, both options are based on the use of a model already tested and
          approved by other companies. However, the difference lies in how each is used. In franchising, an
          established brand is used and the model adopted by it is replicated.</p>
        <p class="color-white">Therefore, there is no flexibility to act differently and royalties must be paid to
          the franchisor. In addition, the franchisor's brand is visible to everyone. With White Label, you use your
          brand and have the flexibility to adapt the solution to your business needs. With White Label, you can
          customize the product or service with the face of your company and have more freedom over the selling
          rules.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="article-subtitle">Why invest in the white label service model?</h3>
        <p class="color-white">Normally, the white label is adopted by companies that want to expand their
          operations. However, they do not have the necessary experience, nor the interest, to develop a solution in
          the field in which they want to start operating.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="article-subtitle">Advantages of the white label service for your Interpreting Agency</h3>
        <h3 class="article-subtitle">1 - No advanced technical knowledge is required</h3>
        <p class="color-white">The White Label supplier is responsible for developing, innovating, and maintaining
          the solution in operation. Being the owner of the technology also tends to facilitate the usability of the
          solution, offering support for implementation and maintenance.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="article-subtitle">2 - Focus on sales</h3>
        <p class="color-white">The first advantage directly impacts this one. Since your team does not have to
          worry about the development of the technology, there is more room to focus only on sales.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="article-subtitle">3 - Pricing Autonomy</h3>
        <p class="color-white">This is one of the main advantages of White label. The owner of the technology does
          not impose the resale value and your company can acquire the solution for a low cost and resell it with an
          excellent profit margin.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="article-subtitle">4 - Increased willingness to purchase your product</h3>
        <p class="color-white">The public is not always willing to buy your core offering. For example, your
          company's main solution is management software, but the customer you want to reach has not gone through
          the digital transformation. Therefore, they may end up resisting the purchase of your service.
          With a White Label digital solution, your company can offer to cross-sell: management software + website
          for digital presence. Thus, the customer gets more solutions from a single provider and your company
          ensures an increase in the average ticket.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="article-subtitle">5 - Scalability and revenue predictability</h3>
        <p class="color-white">With White Label, your business can meet the growing demands without having to make
          large investments in new technologies. In addition, your company can create recurring plans, where the
          customer pays on a monthly subscription basis.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="article-subtitle">6 - Creation of value perception </h3>
        <p class="color-white">With the "plus" of the White Label solution, your company strengthens the bond with
          the client, since he/she has access to more than one solution in one place. In other words, besides
          expanding the service portfolio of your business, you also add value by offering additional solutions that
          solve the customer's pains.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="article-subtitle">7 - Fast and low-cost innovation</h3>
        <p class="color-white">We already said it: with White Label, it is not your company that has to develop
          the technology. But you gain quick access to easy-to-implement innovations. In other words, it is the best
          way to innovate in your company.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="article-subtitle">8 - Low application risk</h3>
        <p class="color-white">Continuing with the ownership of the technology, your company has experienced and
          knowledgeable service professionals to implement the solution, with less chance of technical problems and
          more support. Thus, your company does not need to hire a team to meet technical demands.</p>
        <p class="color-white">The advantages are very good, aren't they? And they are many more concerning the
          disadvantage of not having any influence on the technological development of the service.</p>
        <p class="color-white">To choose the ideal solution, think about your interpreting agency, your needs,
          your market, and also the characteristics and requirements of your clients. Understand what options are on
          the market to offer a unique and complete experience for those people.</p>
