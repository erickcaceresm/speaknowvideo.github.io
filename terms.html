          history.</p>
        <p class="text-copy_alt">If the Paid Membership period is limited, a periodic payment will be automatically

          this automatic periodic payment directly in PayPal or in your Cookie-Script account.</p>

          amount of VAT, which may be added to the charge, is 21% of the total billing amount and will be added
          depending on the location and legal entity of the purchaser. According to the European Union Council Directive
