        <p>Those who interpret information from a source language to a target language bear tremendous responsibility. They must:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Translate information as accurately as possible, paying careful attention to regional dialects and cultural sensitivities.</li>
          <li>Respect the confidentiality of all parties involved; this is particularly important when working in courtrooms, within the medical community, or in situations where proprietary information is being shared or discussed but applies to all situations requiring such services.</li>
          <li>Conduct themselves in a professional manner, regardless of the type of information that is being interpreted.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>While the gist of the code of ethics is similar across the board, many interpreting-specific organizations have come up with their own code of ethics by which members must abide.</p>
      <p>For the most part, every professional is beholden to a “boilerplate” set of ethics. A Code of Ethics helps protect both the client and the interpreter. You should only work with a professional translation/interpretation services provider that upholds a similar roster of ethical guidelines.</p>
      <div class="mb-5">
        <p>Ethics allows health care interpreters to accomplish a variety of goals, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Making patients feel that he or she is being attentive and responsive to their needs.</li>
          <li>Allowing for effective communication that truly conveys meaning.</li>
          <li>Parties feel that the interpreter is fair and impartial, which makes them more comfortable with the three-party exchange of information that must occur in health care interpretation.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="mb-5">
        <p>Establish basic qualifications for interpreters and translators:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Medical fluency in English and the target language.</li>
          <li>Training in medical interpreting/translating.</li>
          <li>Experience in medical interpreting/translating.</li>
        </ul>
