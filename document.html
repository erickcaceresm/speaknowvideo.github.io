        <p class="text-copy">The translation certification must attest to the fact that the translation was performed by
          a great qualified translator fluent in both languages to satisfy the accurate requirement. We only use
          professional translators and 100% of our workforce meets this requirement. An authorized signer attests to
          this fact on the certification. We also include free revisions to ensure the final translation is 100%
          accurate.</p>
        <p class="text-copy">We take more steps when preparing your translation to ensure acceptance by the widest range
          of clients. We provide all certified translations on company letterhead with order and page numbers in all
          pages along with our contact info and ATA corporate member number. Our certification specifies that the
          translator has any relation, personal or otherwise, with the owner of the document and when needed we can have
          the certification notarized to authenticate the identity of the authorized signer and provide you with the
          original copies.</p>

      <h1 class="title-primary title-primary_alt">Hippa compliant interpreters and translation services</h1>
      <p class="text-copy fw-bolder">All of ours Interpreters are certified by reputable associations, such as:</p>
      <p class="text-copy">The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, commonly known
        as HIPAA, is a series of regulatory standards that outline the lawful use and disclosure of protected health
        information (PHI). HIPAA compliance is regulated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and
        enforced by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR).</p>
      <p class="text-copy">It is a law that protects patient medical information and privacy. It applies to
        health care providers, health insurance companies, and third-party entities that process health information. But
        it also applies to individuals who work closely with health care providers and handle patient health
        information, including lawyers, consultants, and medical interpreters.</p>
      <p class="text-copy">Covered entity healthcare providers may need to use HIPAA interpreters to
        communicate with a patient. Covered entities may use an interpreter to communicate with a patient (i.e., because
        the patient speaks another language, is deaf, or is hard of hearing) – without the need for the individual to
        authorize use or disclosure of PHI – provided certain conditions are met.</p>
      <p class="text-copy">Protected health information (PHI) is any demographic information that can be
        used to identify a patient or client of a HIPAA-beholden entity. Common examples of PHI include names,
        addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, medical records, financial information, and full facial
        photos to name a few.</p>
      <p class="text-copy">PHI transmitted, stored, or accessed electronically also falls under HIPAA
        regulatory standards and is known as electronic protected health information, or ePHI. ePHI is regulated by the
        HIPAA Security Rule, which was an addendum to HIPAA regulation enacted to account for changes in medical
        technology.</p>
